- 👋 Hi, I’m @guillaume-longatte
- 👀 I’m interested in electrochemistry, especially bioelectrochemistry and more generally biophysics from both theoritical and experimental point of view. Until now, my theoritical work have been based on the creation of mathematical models based on the physical chemistry laws (electrochemistry, thermodynamics, kinetics, photochyemistry...)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning molecular electrocatalysis from an experimental point of view.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bioelectrochemistry with a theoritical part if possible.
- 📫 How to reach me longatte.g@gmail.com
